The addressee is located in Cairo where the sender visits him regularly (l. 12; l. 9). Two men have come from Maghrib, the sender writes, who have told him that the Maghreb is so full that people started to emigrate (l. 10-11). On the verso side the sender announces that there is good wheat for sale in his town eight waybas for one dinar and bread costs three ar\u1e6d\u0101l for one dirham. This was apparently a good price as he adds that this constituted a great blessing (l. 5). The sender discusses the price of textiles in Cairo. He also writes that a request to buy a turban for a certain Ab\u016b A\u02bfl\u0101 could not be met for less than one and a half dinar (ll. 7-9). Ab\u016b A\u02bfl\u0101's request to buy him chickpeas, however, the sender was able to fulfill for a price of fifty dirham (l. 9). The sender finally writes that something was included in his letter."
