On the other three sides the original cutting lines have been preserved. In the middle on the left half of the papyrus is a large lacuna. There are many ink spots between the lines.\u00a0\nVerso: This letter consists of twenty lines written on the verso of which three lines upside down above the text and one line in the right margin. The last four lines of the letter are written on the recto upside down in the top margin. Because these four lines of the letter on the verso are complete, while the letter on the recto misses the right half, we can conclude that the letter on the recto was written before the one on the verso. The letter is complete at the top."
